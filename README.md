# pap4sg

Introduction
============

Link to the app on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.org.pap.pickle&hl=en

This is the source code for the #PAP4SG Android App. Normally, companies would not release the source code so easily due to copyright and intellectual property. However, I was able to obtain it through a process called "Reverse Engineering".

This article may be a little too technical for Singaporeans to appreciate. No worries, you may skip this section and move on to the section Rationale to understand why this project.

Android (and iPhone) apps frequently use 3rd party software libraries ("software code") to implement awesome functionality for their apps.

Through the Reverse Engineering, I was able to discover those libraries too. I shall list them here. Please Google to find out how to obtain those open-source code.

Android apps are often created using the high-level Java computer programming language. Any ICT, computer science or computer engineering student, or software programmer can easily read, understand, modify and rebuild this app from source.

Rationale (and Rant)
=========

In the interest of transparency, this party has none. We Singaporeans are facing this behemoth for the past many decades of tyranny and non-accountability. In addition, the PAP says Singapore lacks talents in the ICT industry. This source code leak is testament to the contrary.

Much has happened to us over the past month, including the death of student Benjamin Lim and Dominique Lee. Fi anything it goes to show that this political party lacks transparency. Let's start with the app first. If that party cannot tolerate openess on a simple thing as an app, then hopefully this will really blow a hole in their cloak of secrecy.

Please note, that if I can see the source code of your app, I can do the same to many other apps too. 

I'll be uploading this code on other sites too.
